If you have any inquiries, please feel free to send an email to [mthteo@gmail.com](mailto:mthteo@gmail.com) or message me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melvinhteo/)!

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
### finnit Todo List -> [Take a Look](https://github.com/meleongg/finnit)👀
Polishing my HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals while exploring the ins and outs of webpack!

### nwPlus Hackathons Discord Bot -> [Take a Look](https://github.com/nwplus/nwPlus_discord_bot)👀
Working with [@nwPlus](https://github.com/nwplus) to launch this project into open source and help other hackathons run virtually via Discord.
It was very successful at both [HackCamp](https://hackcamp.nwplus.io/) and [nwHacks 2021](https://www.nwhacks.io/), but there is still much to improve!
